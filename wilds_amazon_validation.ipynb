Good tending , some good playmaking, better shooting and wonderful  forechecking from Marner, Komo and Kadri. The D-men where inconsistent, but my guess is that Gardiner is trying foolishly to pick up where Panie and  Kadri left off instead of emulating  the more junior Rielly.  That kind of foolishness doesn't work in this league, unless you are Bobby Orr and that ain't gonna happen. any time soon.  Mathews is who he is, he ain't Crosby, McDavid or a real great player. Other than some skating and shooting, he doesn't have the natural skills those players  dominate with. However, that being said he could be a very good weapon and a solid two way player like Kesler  if he wants to work at it.

      "Whazzie: listen to Eudsie if you truly love the game and your team. There were a great deal of good things that came out of last night ' s game for your boys. Good tending, some good playmaking, better shooting and wonderful forechecking fkom Marner, Komo and Kadri. The D - men where inconsistent, but my goess is that Gardiner is trying foolishly to pick up where Panie and Kadri left off instead of emulating the more junior Rielly. That kind of foolishness doesn ' t work in thi8 league, unless you are Bobby Orr and that ain ' t gonna happen. any time soon. Mathews is who he is, he ain ' t Crosby, McDavid or a real great player.
