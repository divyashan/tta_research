There does not appear to be any reason to fear that the sub-diaconate is being offered as a substitute. Both Othodoxy and Catholicism recognize that deacons, priests, and bishops receive the one same sacrament of Holy Orders, and subdeacons do not. The glass ceiling here is women receiving that sacrament. Those who resist women priests also resist women deacons with the same violence--because there is but one sacrament. Once the faithful see women vested on the altar and preaching globally every Sunday, the barrier to the priesthood and episcopate for women will be torn down. Sure, there will be those who argue, this far and no farther, but once women are acknowledged as recipients of this sacrament the internal walls within grades of that sacrament become paper thin, literally. There is a risk; it's a question of strategy--how best destroy the beast of chauvinism.\",\n",

Let all blacks be nominated for an award and it is cheered as diversity, let the same group nominate all whites and it is racist.

There are Muslim countries like Turkey (which nightclub do you want to celebrate New Year's Eve in?).  I think Islam is a blight.

Islam in North America is called the \"Religion of Peace\" but their Mid East roots do not support this assumption. Islam is a Political entity that must rule not just be a Religion as we see everywhere it dominates as in many African and all Mid Eastern Countries. These Countries have blasphemy laws protecting only Islam, WHY?? They are expecting those same laws of protection as we see now being put forward by Islamic people in our political system.

Lincoln reacted and invaded to preserve the Union but the bottom line is the underlying issue of slavery. No slavery no war, right? Most wars have the simple surface reason for their beginning but behind that is real geo-political desires. But all of that does not matter, that flag is a symbol and not a positive one, it is used as a sort of visual code word for racism and to deny it is being intellectually dishonest.  It is a flag of a defeated nation and a defeated ideology just like the Nazi flag and it has no place in a public school in the 21 century save in a lesson.

The stories of arbitrary miss-management that are driving unemployment ever higher in eastern Oregon.  Curry County Sheriff turning in his badge in frustration for lack of resources dud to dwindling tax base engineered by arbitrary over reaching Federal Government policies.  Or how about the thousands of miles of roads proposed to be removed from Oregon wild lands, cutting off public and fire access?  What is the one issue the people of Oregon demand universally?  Access to the wild lands?  You are not reporting that it is being taken away.  More closed roads.  More illegal Federal Police, guns drawn, stops ... as reported by the Sheriff of Grant County.  \n",

Curry County Sheriff turning in his badge in frustration for lack of resources dud to dwindling tax base engineered by arbitrary over reaching Federal Government policies.  Or how about the thousands of miles of roads proposed to be removed from Oregon wild lands, cutting off public and fire access?  What is the one issue the people of Oregon demand universally?
